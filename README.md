# Mathematical-Statistics-II
Mathematical Statistics II is a seminar course which continues to discuss information covered in Probability and Mathematical Statistics I. It deals mainly with statistical models for the relationship among variables. The theory of linear regression models is examined in detail. Other topics may include theory for generalize linear models, Bayesian inference, and nonparametric statistics. 

This specific repository will contain the presentations I produce for this course. Each week different students are asked to prepare lectures for the seminar. The first lecture I was asked to complete focused on multiple regression coefficients
